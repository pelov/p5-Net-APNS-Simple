    - Open and close the connection to the apns server in the constructor and destructor and not in
      notify(). This will help to see early errors during connection. Also, the connection can be
      reused for sending multiple notifications which are not known in advance.
    - Use IO::Async to wait for responses from connect and notify.
    - Group together the write of all HTTP/2 frames so that they can be send in a single TLS record.
    - Don't queue all notifications and use a single notify() call. Instead prepare() returns an object
      which is then send by notify() which also returns directly the response headers and body.
      Eventually, prepare could be dropped.
    - Send any pending HTTP/2 frames in connection close.
